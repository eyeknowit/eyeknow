          <p class="blog-date">16-01-2017</p>
          <p class="ahref" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">The Great Hanshin earthquake, measuring 6.9 Mw, rattles the southern region of Hyōgo Prefecture, reaching a maximum Shindo intensity of VII. The devastating event results in the tragic loss of 5,502–6,434 lives, with 251,301–310,000 individuals displaced from their homes.</p>

            The Great Hanshin Earthquake occurred on January 17, 1995, at 05:46:53 JST (January 16 at 20:46:53 UTC) in the southern part of Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, particularly in the Hanshin region. It registered a magnitude of 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale and reached a maximum intensity of 7 on the JMA Seismic Intensity Scale (equivalent to XI–XII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale). The seismic activity persisted for approximately 20 seconds, with the earthquake's focus situated 17 km below its epicenter, on the northern end of Awaji Island, about 20 km away from the center of Kobe city.
            <br>
            Tragically, around 6,434 individuals lost their lives due to this earthquake, with approximately 4,600 of them in Kobe. Among major cities, Kobe, with its population of 1.5 million, experienced the most severe tremors as it was the closest to the epicenter. This event stands as Japan's deadliest earthquake in the 20th century, second only to the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923, which claimed over 105,000 lives.

          <p class="p-blog">
            A predominant cause of major earthquakes in Japan is the subduction of either the Philippine Sea Plate or Pacific Plate. The mechanisms behind these seismic events involve energy release within the subducting plate or the accumulation and sudden release of stress in the overlying plate, particularly prevalent in the coastal regions of northeastern Japan.

            The Great Hanshin earthquake, however, falls into a distinct category known as an "inland shallow earthquake." Unlike the typical subduction-related earthquakes, these events occur along active faults. Despite potentially lower magnitudes, inland shallow earthquakes can be exceptionally destructive, often transpiring near populated areas, given that their hypocenters are located less than 20 km below the surface.

            The epicenter of the Great Hanshin earthquake was north of Awaji Island, just south of Kobe. Its propagation followed the Nojima Fault on Awaji to the southwest and the Suma and Suwayama faults to the northeast, traversing the center of Kobe. Observations of fault deformations indicated east–west compression, aligning with known crustal movements in the region.

            Distinct from other earthquakes in western Japan from 1891 to 1948, the 1995 earthquake exhibited a strike-slip mechanism, accommodating east–west shortening of the Eurasian Plate due to its collision with the Philippine Sea Plate in central Honshu.

            On January 17, 1995, at 05:46 JST, the earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.3, unfolded over 20 seconds. The south side of the Nojima Fault experienced significant movement, shifting 1.5 meters to the right and 1.2 meters downwards during this brief but impactful seismic event. Four foreshocks preceded the main quake, commencing with the largest (Mj 3.7) at 18:28 on the previous day.

          <p class="ahref" style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Seismic Intensity Shifts in the Wake of the Great Hanshin Earthquake:</p>
          <p class="p-blog">
          The Great Hanshin earthquake marked a historic moment as it became the first earthquake in Japan officially measured at the highest Level 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency's (JMA) seismic intensity scale, known as "shindo" in Japanese. Following this significant event, seismic intensity observation practices in Japan underwent a comprehensive mechanization process, implemented in April 1996. Additionally, JMA seismic intensity Levels 5 and 6 were further refined, each divided into two levels starting from October 1996.
          
          A post-event investigation conducted by JMA revealed that specific areas in northern Awaji Island (now Awaji City) and the cities of Kobe, Ashiya, Nishinomiya, and Takarazuka experienced tremors with a seismic intensity of Level 7. This groundbreaking occurrence prompted a reassessment and restructuring of seismic intensity scales and observation methodologies.
          
          The seismic activity extended across the Kansai, Chūgoku, Shikoku, and Chūbu regions, registering seismic intensity levels ranging from 4 to 6 at various observation points. This comprehensive evaluation highlighted the need for a nuanced understanding of seismic intensity variations across different geographical locations, leading to the refinement of observational techniques and intensity scale categorizations.

          <p class="ahref" style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Impact of the Great Hanshin Earthquake:</p>
          <p class="p-blog">
          The Great Hanshin earthquake left widespread and severe devastation in its wake. Nearly 400,000 buildings, numerous elevated road and rail bridges, and 120 quays in the port of Kobe suffered irreparable damage. The quake sparked approximately 300 fires, engulfing large portions of the city. Common disruptions included water, electricity, and gas supplies, making it challenging for residents to return home amid persistent aftershocks lasting several days, with 74 being strong enough to be felt.

          The majority of the 6,434 deaths occurred in cities and suburbs in Hyōgo Prefecture. Tragically, 68 children under 18 were orphaned, and 332 children lost one parent.

          In the hardest-hit areas, one in five buildings was either completely destroyed or rendered uninhabitable. Kobe's central business district saw around 22% of its offices rendered unusable, and over half of the houses were deemed unfit for occupancy. Notably, high-rise buildings constructed after the 1981 building code exhibited less damage than those built earlier.

          The damage extended to highways and subways, with the collapse of the Kobe Route of the Hanshin Expressway becoming an iconic image worldwide. Despite initial beliefs in construction negligence, it was later revealed that most collapsed structures were constructed correctly according to 1960s building codes, which were later discovered to be inadequate. The damage to railways was significant, with only 30% of the Osaka-Kobe railway tracks operational immediately after the earthquake. The Kobe Municipal Subway, although resuming limited service the day after the quake, operated with speed restrictions until July 21, 1995.

          Artificial islands, including Rokkō Island and Port Island in Kobe, experienced severe subsidence due to liquefaction, causing flooding. However, Kansai International Airport, built to the latest standards, and the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge, under construction near the epicenter, remained largely unaffected.
