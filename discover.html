            Johari explained that the decision was made in response to Kenya's aeronautical authorities denying Tanzania's request for all-cargo flight operations by Air Tanzania Company Limited. The statement emphasized the rescission of approvals for Kenya Airways (KQ) to conduct passenger flights between Nairobi and Dar es Salaam under Third and Fourth Freedom Traffic Rights, starting January 22, 2024.

            As per Johari's statement, there will be no passenger flights by Kenya Airways between Nairobi and Dar es Salaam from the specified date. The decision is a reciprocal measure, taken in response to the Republic of Kenya's refusal of Tanzania's request for all-cargo flight operations by Air Tanzania Company Limited under Fifth Freedom Traffic Rights between Nairobi and Third countries. This refusal is deemed contrary to Section 4 of the Memorandum of Understanding on Air Services signed between Tanzania and Kenya on November 24, 2016, in Nairobi, Kenya.
            This move is expected to disrupt significant aviation services between the two countries.

            On Friday, the Biden administration unveiled new measures aimed at reducing the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for over a quarter of the current global warming. As part of the initiative, oil and gas companies would, for the first time, be obligated to pay fees corresponding to their methane emissions, potentially resulting in significant financial penalties.

            Methane, the second-most-abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, possesses 80 times the short-term warming potency. The proposed fees are introduced against the backdrop of record-high levels of American gas and oil production.

            Methane emissions emanate from various sources such as pipelines, drill sites, and storage facilities. Some producers resort to flaring, burning excess gas at production sites, a process that not only releases carbon dioxide but also, at times, methane.

          <p class="p-blog">
            Proposing a fee ranging from $900 to $1,500 for each additional ton of methane emissions, this plan represents the inaugural federal pricing mechanism for greenhouse gas pollution.

          <p class="ahref" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Curb measures to be taken.</p>
          <p class="p-blog">
            The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing charges on major energy producers to address methane emissions, starting at $900 per ton for exceeding federally defined levels, with increments to $1,200 by 2025 and stabilizing at $1,500 per ton in 2026. This fee is part of the Biden administration's new methane regulations for the oil and gas industry. Prior EPA measures include mandates for detecting and addressing methane leaks, limiting flaring (except in emergencies). Additionally, Congress has allocated over $1 billion for grants to enhance methane monitoring, data collection, and leak identification and remediation efforts.

          So, South Africa has brought Israel to the ICJ, also known as the World Court, claiming that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and failing to prevent it.
          During the first day of hearings, South Africa argued that Israel's leadership has openly expressed genocidal intent in public comments related to the war. They also stated that Israel's military actions demonstrate a pattern of genocidal conduct.

          South Africa presented evidence of the extensive destruction caused by the bombardment of Gaza and the deliberate restriction of essential resources like food, water, medicine, and electricity. They believe that these actions show Israel's intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza as a group.

          In their 84-page filing to the court, South Africa detailed the acts they consider to be expressions of genocidal intent, including statements made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other members of the Israeli cabinet.

          South Africa has requested the court to issue provisional measures, ordering Israel to halt its war in Gaza. They believe that this is necessary to protect the rights of the Palestinian people from further harm.
