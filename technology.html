            The Apple Vision Pro, an upcoming mixed reality headset from Apple Inc., was unveiled on June 5, 2023, during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference. Its official launch is slated for February 2, 2024, in the United States, followed by an international release later in the year. This groundbreaking product marks Apple's first entry into a major new product category since the introduction of the Apple Watch in 2015.

          <p class="p-blog">
            Positioned as a "spatial computer," the Vision Pro seamlessly integrates digital media with the real world, offering a unique user experience. The device incorporates various physical inputs, including motion gestures, eye tracking, and speech recognition, allowing users to interact intuitively with the system. Apps can be placed anywhere around the user, taking on customizable shapes and sizes to match individual preferences. The surroundings are displayed behind apps through multiple cameras providing a passthrough video. The Environments feature enables users to hide the passthrough video, replacing it with various background options.

            An interesting feature of the Vision Pro is EyeSight, which displays the user's virtual eyes on a screen, offering insights into their immersion status and facilitating improved communication with others.

            Designed to function as a standalone device with its visionOS, a derivative of iOS tailored for mixed reality apps, the Vision Pro can also be connected to a Mac to serve as a virtual display.

          <p class="p-blog">
            Today, Samsung Switzerland launched the Galaxy A15 and Galaxy A25 smartphones for the local market, marking the progression of the affordable duo's European rollout, with the Galaxy A25 having been previously released in Germany and France.
          </p>
          <figure class="image">
            <img src="images/a15.JPG" alt=""

          </figure>
          <p class="p-blog">
            The Galaxy A15 is offered in two variants distinguished solely by their chipset and cellular connectivity. The LTE version is equipped with a Helio G99, whereas the 5G model features a Dimensity 6100+ chipset. Both versions share identical specifications, including a 6.5” Super AMOLED display, a 50 MP main camera, and a 5,000 mAh battery.
            Samsung is making the phone available in all three colors - Black, Blue, and Yellow. The non-5G model is priced at CHF 179 (€190), while the 5G variant is priced at CHF 209 (€225). These phones are currently accessible for purchase at brick-and-mortar stores and are expected to be available online soon.
          </p>
          <p class="p-blog">
            The Galaxy A25 stands out as the best, chiefly due to its deployment of the Exynos 1280 chipset. Other key features, such as the display size, battery capacity, and the main rear camera, remain consistent from the other A15 versions.
            In Switzerland, Samsung is retailing the A25 for CHF 279, aligning closely with the price in Germany at €300. However, the phone carries a higher price tag in France at €320, despite offering identical memory configurations and color options.

            The fact that this feature came to make our work easier, it's actually the opposite. When you type something, it insists it's predictions are correct and replaces whatever you had typed.
            For example when you want to type "Hello world!" but instead it suggests "Hello there!"

            Can you relate...

          <p class="ahref" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">2. Websites that have more than 3 captcha's</p>
          <p class="p-blog">
            We understand that there maybe some bots which try to access websites, so maybe one captcha is okay, or even better, type what you see indecisively.
            But there are this websites that have more than 2 captchas.

            For example when you are required to continuosly spot the traffic lights and crosswalks, and bicycles. It feels like being in a Dora the explorer show. Do we need all those tests to proof that you are human!, it doesn't make sense, it makes someone angry...

          <p class="p-blog">
          In most cases when the coloured ink cartridge is over, and the black ink cartridge is full, and what you actually need is the black ink, it refuses to print in black. It tells you to replace the colored cartridge for it to work. Maybe this is not really relatable...

            <img src="images/printerz.jpg" alt=""
              class="w-100">
          </figure>
          <p class="p-blog">Maybe another relatable scenario where the printers, on purchase, they actually have a good affordable price, like $70 to keep you in their ecosystem, and then they sell their cartridges twice or thrice the price, like $140, since they know you wont rant to buy a new printer.

          <p class="p-blog">And when you opt to purchase a cheaper catridge to save on cost, it actually fails on the printer. They are set to detect their standard manufactured cartridges. This is soooooo annoying, why tho'!

            Safaricom's mySafaricom app is really useful when it's working smoothly. It's been around for a couple of years now and they've made some great updates to make it even better. One of the best things is how they integrated M-PESA into the app. It's super convenient to have all those features in one place.

            But I understand your frustration with the constant M-PESA transaction failures. It can be really annoying when the app doesn't fetch the STK or freezes on the PIN input field. Hopefully, Safaricom will fix these issues soon so we can enjoy a smoother experience.
